# ib-api
Ruby interface to Interactive Brokers' TWS API 

Reimplementation of the basic functions of ib-ruby


----
`ib-ruby`   offers a modular access to the TWS-API-Interface of Interactive Brokers.

`ib-api`    provides a simple interface to low-level TWS API-calls.  

----

In its plain vanilla usage, it just exchanges messages with the TWS. The user is responsible for any further data processing.


Even then, it needs just a few lines of code to place an order

```ruby
# connect with default parameters 
ib =  IB::Connection.new 

# define a contract to deal with
the_stock =  IB::Stock.new symbol: 'TAP'

# order 100 shares for 35 $ 
limit_order = IB::Order.new  limit_price: 35, order_type: 'LMT',  total_quantity: 100, action: :buy
ib.send_message :PlaceOrder,
        :order => limit_order,
        :contract => the_stock,
        :local_id => ib.next_local_id

# wait until the orderstate message returned
ib.wait_for :OrderStatus

# print the Orderstatus
puts ib.recieved[:OrderStatus].to_human

# => ["<OrderState: Submitted #17/1528367295 from 2000 filled 0.0/100.0 at 0.0/0.0 why_held >"]

```
## Minimal TWS-Version

`ib-api` is tested via the _stable ib-Gateway_ (Version 9.72) 

## Tests

are invoked by 

```
bundle exec guard
# or
bundle exec rake spec
```
Integration tests on order-placements are not included. To run the test suite its thus safe to use a _real Account_.
You have to edit `spec/spec.yml` and replace the `:account`-Setting with your own `AccountID`, even if you connect to a single account.
